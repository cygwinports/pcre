ldesc: "The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular
expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl,
with just a few differences.  The current implementation of PCRE
(release 6.x) corresponds approximately with Perl 5.8, including support
for UTF-8 encoded strings and Unicode general category properties."
